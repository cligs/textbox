### Principles of Data Curation
 
* Texts have been obtained from various sources, among them _Ebooks libres et gratuits_, _Wikisource_ and _Project Gutenberg_ and have not been further normalised. 
* The texts have been submitted to a simple text quality assurance protocol, essentially a spellcheck based on a dictionary and a curated list of named entities. The result of this check can be found in the file `spellcheck-report.csv`. (See our toolbox for the relevant resources.)
* All texts have been encoded according to the _Guidelines_ of the Text Encoding Initiative. The `teiHeader` notably contains information about the digital and print sources of the materials. The text is marked up with basic textual structures, such as parts, chapters, headings and paragraphs. Front and back matter such as prefaces or notes have been marked-up as such. The XML-TEI files are valid against a schema which is available online and referenced in each file.  
* Each text has an identifier which corresponds to the filename of the XML-TEI file. Metadata has been collected about each novel and integrated into the teiHeader. The metadata table provided separatedly in the `metadata.csv` file contains a subset of these metadata for the researchers' convenience, with identifiers linking table and files. 
* The plain text files in the "txt" folder have been automatically built from the XML-TEI files. They contain only the text body without front or back matter or notes and without any chapter headings. 
* If you would like to create your own metadata table or extract the plain text from the TEI files in a different way, please have a look at our toolbox which provides submodules for this.
* In case you notice errors of any kind in the text collection, please use the issue tracker here on GitHub to notify us. We will be glad to fix them.
